  ## Description
  User Story

```md
  Our project is called "Rate my Cow/Giraffe", an image sharing website dedicated to cows and giraffes. Users can sign up by entering a username, password, email address, and age. The user's data will be saved and they will be able to join the community. Once logged in, users may create their own posts consisting of a title, description, and an image of their choice. The profile page allows the user to view their own posts. Other users may log in and view everyone's posts on the community reviews page. They can also click on another user's post and leave a comment.
